# My Machine Learning Journey: 17 Algorithms from Scratch

### About This Project

I used to see Machine Learning as a collection of complex theories. I was comfortable with the concepts, but when I dove into the **IBM Machine Learning with Python** course on Coursera, I realized how much more there was to learn. To solidify my understanding and bridge the gap between theory and practice, I undertook this comprehensive project to build 17 core machine learning models from scratch.

Each algorithm is in its own dedicated repository, containing the full implementation, analysis, and relevant datasets.
